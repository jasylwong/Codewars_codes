Given an array of strings, reverse them and their order in such way that their length stays the same as the length of the original inputs.

def reverse(a):
    joined = ''.join(a)
    reversed = joined[::-1]
    len_of_words = [len(i) for i in a]
    output = []
    progress = 0
    for i in len_of_words:
        output.append(reversed[progress:i + progress])
        progress += i
    return output
